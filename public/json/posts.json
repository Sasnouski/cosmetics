    "text": "At the bottom of most bottles, there is an indentation. This is known as a punt (or kick-up). There is no consensus on the purpose of this, but the most likely explanation is that it is a tradition leftover from the days when wine bottles were hand blown. Hand blowing glass required the use of a pontil, a technique which left a “punt mark” (a word derived from “pontil”) on the base of the bottle. By indenting the point where the pontil was attached, the scar would not scratch the table or make the bottle unstable. This also had a function of making the bottle more stable, and less likely to tip over, if there was some imperfection in a flat bottomed bottle. ",

    "text": "Why the standard sized wine bottle is 750ml, is not entirely clear, it has simply evolved into the standard size by custom. You could argue that the old imperial bottle of one sixth of a gallon may have something to do with it, but it could also be that 750ml is just about the right amount for a meal for two. Two to three glasses per person in a bottle. There is a story that 750ml is the size of bottle that could be hand-blown with a single lung full of air. The bottom line is that no one is really sure.",

Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
